# Getting Started

TODO: Set up the Python environment (install Detectron2), or use the virtual environment

* Create a fresh environment
* `pip install wheel`
* `pip install jupyter torch torchvision`
* Install Detectron2 as in : https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/INSTALL.md

For Torch 1.7 / CUDA 11.0 (which was the latest at the time)
```
python -m pip install detectron2 -f \
  https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/wheels/cu110/torch1.7/index.html
```

Set up OpenCV. Detectron2 requires Python 3.6 or higher so you will have to install from source according to this resource:
